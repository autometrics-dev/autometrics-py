# autometrics-py

A Python decorator that makes it easy to understand the error rate, response time, and production usage of any function in your code. Jump straight from your IDE to live Prometheus charts for each HTTP/RPC handler, database method, or other piece of application logic.

Autometrics for Python provides:

1. A decorator that can create [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics for your functions and class methods throughout your code base.
2. A helper function that will write corresponding Prometheus queries for you in a Markdown file.

See [Why Autometrics?](https://github.com/autometrics-dev#why-autometrics) for more details on the ideas behind autometrics.

## Features

- âœ¨ `autometrics` decorator instruments any function or class method to track the
  most useful metrics
- ðŸ’¡ Writes Prometheus queries so you can understand the data generated without
  knowing PromQL
- ðŸ”— Create links to live Prometheus charts directly into each functions docstrings (with tooltips coming soon!)
- ðŸ“Š (Coming Soon!) Grafana dashboard showing the performance of all
  instrumented functions
- ðŸš¨ (Coming Soon!) Generates Prometheus alerting rules using SLO best practices
  from simple annotations in your code
- âš¡ Minimal runtime overhead

## Using autometrics-py

- Set up a [Prometheus instance](https://prometheus.io/download/)
- Configure prometheus to scrape your application ([check our instructions if you need help](https://github.com/autometrics-dev#5-configuring-prometheus))
- Include a .env file with your prometheus endpoint `PROMETHEUS_URL=your endpoint`. If this is not defined, the default endpoint will be `http://localhost:9090/`
- `pip install autometrics`
- Import the library in your code and use the decorator for any function:

```py
from autometrics import autometrics

@autometrics
def sayHello:
   return "hello"

```

- To access the PromQL queries for your decorated functions, run `help(yourfunction)` or `print(yourfunction.__doc__)`.

- To show tooltips over decorated functions in VSCode, with links to Prometheus queries, try installing [the VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Fiberplane.autometrics).

> Note that we cannot support tooltips without a VSCode extension due to behavior of the [static analyzer](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1921) used in VSCode.

## Development of the package

This package uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as a package manager, with all dependencies separated into three groups:
 - root level dependencies, required
 - `dev`, everything that is needed for development or in ci
 - `examples`, dependencies of everything in `examples/` directory

By default, poetry will only install required dependencies, if you want to run examples, install using this command:

`poetry install --with examples`

Code in this repository is formatted using [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and contains type definitions (which are linted by [pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/))
